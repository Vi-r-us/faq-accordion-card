## Overview

### The challenge

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. **Image Adaptation:** Adapting and displaying different images for both desktop and mobile views while maintaining a responsive design.
2. **3D Card Effect:** Implementing a 3D card effect for the FAQ accordion card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Hover Animations:** Creating floating animations on mouse hover using CSS properties like `transform` and `translate`.
